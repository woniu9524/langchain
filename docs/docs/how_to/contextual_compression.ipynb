        "# 如何使用上下文压缩进行检索\n\n检索时面临的一个挑战是，在将数据摄取到文档存储系统中时，通常不知道该系统将面临的具体查询。这意味着与查询最相关的信息可能隐藏在包含大量无关文本的文档中。在应用程序中传递整个文档可能会导致更昂贵的 LLM 调用和更差的响应。\n\n上下文压缩旨在解决此问题。这个想法很简单：与其立即按原样返回检索到的文档，不如使用给定查询的上下文来压缩它们，从而只返回相关信息。“压缩”在这里既指压缩单个文档的内容，也指整体过滤掉文档。\n\n要使用上下文压缩检索器，您需要：\n\n- 一个基础[检索器](/docs/concepts/retrievers/)\n- 一个文档压缩器\n\n上下文压缩检索器会将查询传递给基础检索器，接收初始文档，然后将它们通过文档压缩器。文档压缩器接收文档列表，通过减少文档内容或完全删除文档来缩短该列表。\n\n## 开始"
