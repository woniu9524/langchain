        "# 如何使用少样本示例\n\n:::info 先决条件\n\n本指南假定您熟悉以下概念：\n- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)\n- [Example selectors](/docs/concepts/example_selectors)\n- [LLMs](/docs/concepts/text_llms)\n- [Vectorstores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)\n\n:::\n\n在本指南中，我们将学习如何创建一个简单的 prompt template，在生成时为模型提供示例输入和输出。为 LLM 提供一些这样的示例称为 [少样本（few-shotting）](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/)，这是一种简单而强大的引导生成的方式，在某些情况下可以显著提高模型性能。\n\n少样本 prompt template 可以由一组示例构建，也可以由一个负责从已定义集合中选择示例子集的 [Example Selector](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/example_selectors/langchain_core.example_selectors.base.BaseExampleSelector.html) 类构建。\n\n本指南将介绍如何使用字符串 prompt template 进行少样本。有关使用聊天消息进行少样本的指南，请参阅 [此处](/docs/how_to/few_shot_examples_chat/)。\n\n## 创建一个用于少样本示例的格式化器\n\n配置一个格式化器，它会将少样本示例格式化为字符串。此格式化器应为 `PromptTemplate` 对象。"
