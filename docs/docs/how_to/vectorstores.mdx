存储和搜索非结构化数据最常见的方法之一是将其嵌入为向量，然后存储生成的嵌入向量。在查询时，将非结构化查询嵌入为向量，并检索与嵌入查询“最相似”的嵌入向量。向量存储负责存储嵌入数据并为您执行向量搜索。

## 开始

本指南展示了与向量存储相关的基本功能。使用向量存储的关键部分是创建要放入其中的向量，而向量通常是通过嵌入创建的。因此，建议您在深入研究之前，先熟悉[文本嵌入模型接口](/docs/how_to/embed_text)。

在使用向量存储之前，我们需要加载一些数据并初始化一个嵌入模型。

我们想使用 OpenAIEmbeddings，所以我们需要获取 OpenAI API Key。

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

# 加载文档，将其分割成块，嵌入每个块，并将其加载到向量存储中。
raw_documents = TextLoader('state_of_the_union.txt').load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
```

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

有许多优秀的向量存储选项，以下是一些免费、开源且完全在本地机器上运行的选项。请查看所有集成以了解许多优秀的托管服务。

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="chroma" label="Chroma" default>

本次演练使用 `chroma` 向量数据库，它作为库在本地机器上运行。

```bash
pip install langchain-chroma
```

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="faiss" label="FAISS">

本次演练使用 `FAISS` 向量数据库，它利用了 Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) 库。

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lance" label="Lance">

本教程展示了如何使用基于 Lance 数据格式的 LanceDB 向量数据库的相关功能。

```bash
pip install lancedb
```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import LanceDB

import lancedb

db = lancedb.connect("/tmp/lancedb")
table = db.create_table(
    "my_table",
    data=[
        {
            "vector": embeddings.embed_query("Hello World"),
            "text": "Hello World",
            "id": "1",
        }
    ],
    mode="overwrite",
)
db = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 相似性搜索

所有向量存储都公开了一个 `similarity_search` 方法。
这将接受传入的文档，为其创建嵌入，然后查找所有与嵌入最相似的文档。

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```

### 按向量进行相似性搜索

还可以使用 `similarity_search_by_vector` 对给定嵌入向量的相似文档进行搜索，它接受一个嵌入向量作为参数而不是字符串。

```python
embedding_vector = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query(query)
docs = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```

## 异步操作

向量存储通常作为需要一些 IO 操作的独立服务运行，因此它们可能被异步调用。这可以带来性能优势，因为您不必浪费时间等待外部服务的响应。如果您使用的是异步框架，例如 [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)，这可能也很重要。

LangChain 支持向量存储上的异步操作。所有方法都可以使用它们的异步对应方法调用，前缀为 `a`，表示 `async`。

```python
docs = await db.asimilarity_search(query)
docs
```

```output
