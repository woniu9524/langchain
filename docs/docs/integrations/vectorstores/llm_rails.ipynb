        "# LLMRails\n\n>[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/) 是一个用于构建 GenAI 应用程序的 API 平台。它提供了一个易于使用的 API，用于文档索引和查询，该 API 由 LLMRails 管理，并针对性能和准确性进行了优化。\n有关如何使用该 API 的更多信息，请参阅 [LLMRails API 文档](https://docs.llmrails.com/)。\n\n您需要安装 `langchain-community`，指令为 `pip install -qU langchain-community`，以使用此集成。\n\n本笔记展示了如何使用与 Langchain 集成的 `LLMRails` 相关的功能。\n请注意，与此类别中的许多其他集成不同，LLMRails 为检索增强生成提供了一个端到端的托管服务，其中包括：\n1. 一种从文档文件中提取文本并将其分割成句子的方法。\n2. 其 নিজস্ব 嵌入模型和向量存储 - 每个文本片段都被编码成向量嵌入并存储在 LLMRails 内部向量存储中。\n3. 一个查询服务，可自动将查询编码为嵌入，并检索最相关的文本片段（包括对 [混合搜索](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search) 的支持）。\n\n所有这些功能都在此 LangChain 集成中得到支持。"

        "# 设置\n\n你需要一个 LLMRails 账户才能在 LangChain 中使用 LLMRails。请按照以下步骤开始：\n1. 如果你还没有 LLMRails 账户，请先[注册](https://console.llmrails.com/signup)。\n2. 接下来你需要创建 API 密钥来访问 API。在语料库视图中点击 **“API Keys”** 标签页，然后点击 **“Create API Key”** 按钮。为你的密钥命名。点击“Create key”，你现在就拥有了一个激活的 API 密钥。请妥善保管此密钥。\n\n要在 LangChain 中使用 LLMRails，你需要以下值：`api_key`。\n你可以通过两种方式将这些值提供给 LangChain：\n\n1. 在你的环境中包含这两个变量：`LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`、`LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`。\n\n> 例如，你可以使用 `os.environ` 和 `getpass` 来设置这些变量，如下所示：\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\nos.environ[\"LLM_RAILS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"LLMRails API Key:\")\nos.environ[\"LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID\"] = getpass.getpass(\"LLMRails Datastore Id:\")\n```\n\n1. 在创建 LLMRails vectorstore 对象时将它们作为参数提供：\n\n```python\nvectorstore = LLMRails(\n    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,\n    datastore_id=datastore_id\n)\n```"
