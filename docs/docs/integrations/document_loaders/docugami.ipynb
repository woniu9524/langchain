        "## 快速开始\n\n1. 创建一个 [Docugami 工作区](http://www.docugami.com)（提供免费试用）\n2. 添加您的文档（PDF、DOCX 或 DOC），并允许 Docugami 对其进行摄取和聚类，形成相似文档集，例如保密协议 (NDA)、租赁协议和服v务协议。该系统支持的文档类型没有固定集，创建的聚类取决于您的特定文档，之后您可以[更改文档集分配](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view)。\n3. 通过工作区的 Developer Playground 创建一个访问令牌。[详细说明](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)\n4. 探索 [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) 以获取已处理文档集 ID 的列表，或者获取特定文档集的文档 ID。\n6. 使用下方详细介绍的 DocugamiLoader 来获取文档的丰富语义块。\n7. 可选地，构建和发布一个或多个[报告或摘要](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports)。这有助于 Docugami 基于您的偏好改进语义 XML 和标签，然后这些标签将作为元数据添加到 DocugamiLoader 输出中。使用诸如[自查询检索器](/docs/how_to/self_query)之类的技术来实现高精度的文档问答。\n\n## 相较于其他分块技术的优势\n\n对文档进行适当分块对于从文档中检索至关重要。存在许多分块技术，包括依赖于空格和基于字符长度递归分块的简单技术。Docugami 提供了一种不同的方法：\n\n1. **智能分块：** Docugami 将每个文档分解为分层语义 XML 树，其中包含不同大小的块，从单个单词或数值到整个章节。这些块遵循文档的语义轮廓，提供了比任意长度或简单的基于空格的分块更有意义的表示。\n2. **语义注释：** 块会用跨文档集一致的语义标签进行注释，从而跨多个文档实现一致的分层查询，即使它们的书写和格式不同。例如，在一组租赁协议中，您可以轻松识别关键条款，如房东 (Landlord)、租户 (Tenant) 或续约日期 (Renewal Date)，以及更复杂的信息，例如任何转租条款 (sub-lease provision) 的措辞，或者特定司法管辖区在终止条款 (Termination Clause) 中是否包含例外条款部分。\n3. **结构化表示：** 此外，XML 树还使用表示标题、段落、列表、表格和其他常见元素的属性来指示每个文档的结构轮廓，并对所有支持的文档格式（如扫描的 PDF 或 DOCX 文件）一致地进行此操作。它能妥善处理长篇文档的特性，如页眉/页脚或多栏流，以实现干净的文本提取。\n4. **附加元数据：** 如果用户一直在使用 Docugami，这些块也会被注释上附加的元数据。这些附加元数据可用于实现高精度的文档问答，而没有上下文窗口限制。有关详细代码演练，请参见下文。"
