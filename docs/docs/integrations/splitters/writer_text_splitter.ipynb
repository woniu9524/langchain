        "# Writer 文本分割器\n\n本笔记本提供了使用 Writer 的 [文本分割器](/docs/concepts/text_splitters/) 的快速入门指南。\n\nWriter 的 [上下文感知分割端点](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/tools#context-aware-text-splitting) 为长文档（最多 4000 字）提供了智能文本分割功能。与简单的基于字符的分割不同，它保留了块之间的语义含义和上下文，非常适合处理长篇内容同时保持连贯性。在 `langchain-writer` 中，我们提供了 Writer 的上下文感知分割端点作为 LangChain 文本分割器的用法。\n\n## 概述\n\n### 集成详情\n| 类 | 包 | 本地 | 可序列化 | JS 支持 | 包下载次数 | 包最新版本 |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------| :---: | :---: |:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| [WriterTextSplitter](https://github.com/writer/langchain-writer/blob/main/langchain_writer/text_splitter.py#L11) | [langchain-writer](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-writer/) |      ❌       |                                       ❌                                       | ❌ | ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/langchain-writer?style=flat-square&label=%20) | ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-writer?style=flat-square&label=%20) |"
