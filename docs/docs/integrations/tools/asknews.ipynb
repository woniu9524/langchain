The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed slimming inflation figures, leading to a conclusion that inflation is being curbed. This has led to a 'soft landing' narrative, causing bullish sentiment in the stock market, with the Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 indices near all-time highs. NVIDIA is set to report earnings next week, and despite its 95% year-to-date growth, it remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

The Fed officials, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, stated that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain. As a result, investors slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, Reddit surged 11% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, while Take-Two Interactive and DXC Technology fell after issuing disappointing earnings guidance.\\nsource: Yahoo\\npublished: May 16 2024 20:08\\nLocation: US, Wall Street\\nDate: September, Thursday\\nOrganization: Atlanta Fed, Cleveland Fed, New York Fed, Fed, Reddit, Take-Two Interactive, DXC Technology, OpenAI, Federal Reserve\\nTitle: President\\nPerson: Loretta Mester, Raphael Bostic, John Williams\\nclassification: Business\\nsentiment: 0\\n</doc>\\n\""
